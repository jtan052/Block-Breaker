Block Breaker is a classic game in which the player bounces a ball with a mouse-controlled paddle in order to break blocks laid about in
various assortments.

## The Game
To begin, leftmouse click to launch the ball from the paddle. The ball will strike blocks and rebound off of them accordingly.
There are various blocks, some needing multiple hits to fully destruct. There are also unbreakable blocks. Different sprites
afford the user visual cues of damage. Upon the ball colliding with anything an impact noise will sound. Upon a blocks
destruction a particle effect will take place. Destroyed blocks will add to a displayed score which persists through levels.
Use your mouse to control the paddle and rebound the ball back towards the blocks advancing when all blocks on that level are destroyed.
In the case that the ball is not caught and passes through a lower threshold the game will end.

To run this game, see the folder BlockBreakerPCBuild and run the application UnityDeveloperCourse2D!
